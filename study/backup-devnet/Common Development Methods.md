# Test-Driven Development
- Initiated by bug or feature request
- Starts with a testing phase
- Shorter development cycles and better final code
- Creates a library of code tests
- Unit tests
	- Testing against small sections or functions of code
	- Units are the smallest part of software that can be tested
	- Simple, focused testing takes place
1. Test-Driven Development cycle
	1. Write a unit test
	2. Test fails
	3. Write code to pass the test
	4. Unit testing passes
	5. Refactoring

# Agile
- Minimizes risks for developing or updating software
	- Budget overages, bugs, etc
- Incemental software iterations released over time
- Ongoing iterations are informed by customer feedback
- Popular base framework for many other methods
## Agile principles
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Response to change over pre-determined plan

# Lean
- Basis for Agile methodology
- Not a modern framework

## Lean Method Considerations
- Elimination of waste
	- Extra features that are unneeded, bugs, etc
- Just-in-time
- Continuous improvement (Kaizen)

1. Identify Value
2. Map value stream
	1. Create a workflow that contains steps to add the value or service
3. Create flow
	1. Identify tool and needs for each step of the value map
4. Establish Pull
	1. ustomers pull value as needed, available whenever needed
5. Seek Perfection
	1. Always be looking for ways to bring improvement and increase efficiencies
 
# Waterfall
- More rigid approach to development
- Each phase must be completed before moving on
- Shortcomings to this rigid approach with modern development
- Everything is planned at the beginning of the project
- No value is created until the end of the process
- Quality can be challenging due to lack of timely feedback

1. Requirements gathering
	1. Requirements specification document
2. System Design
	1. Outline hardware/software reqs
3. Coding
4. Testing
	1. May need to repeat phases within this phase
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance
