# Senate Positions
## Consuls do not exist while Caesar does
- When two consuls veto, there's already special logic for the 2nd veto in place.
	- Need to add logic to remove the consuls as consuls and make them senators

## Adding/Removing Senate Members
- Caesar > Consul > Censor > Senator
	- Caesar and add/remove any position
	- Consul can add||remove Censor & Senator but not caesar or consuls
	- Censor can remove Senator but not caesar, consuls, or other censor
	- Senators cannot add||remove anyone directly, only by proposal
