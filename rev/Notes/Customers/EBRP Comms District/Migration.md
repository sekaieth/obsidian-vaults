# 8-2-23 Coordination Call
Meeting with EBRP + NGA911 to discuss phone migration of admin lines.

They asked if the admin lines need any physical equipment besides the phones.  NGA tech said no.  

EBR currently has DIDs on PRIs that are going to BR Fire, BR Police, EMS, St. George also has lines on their PRIs.  First step would be to port those numbers to REV, REV points the numbers to the SIP trunk to NGA.  NGA would set up a conversion from SIP to PRI for initial cutover, and then they can work with the customer to migrate that PRI to SIP later.
