## Meeting with Gilkey
- Startups everyone does almost everything, engineers do support, etc.
- Move really fast
- Leave breadcrumbs about why decisions were made
- Best startups furiously prioritize user feedback and user experience
	- How do we analyze the user data?  Need to have really good user metrics
	- Watch DAUs?
	- "First Time Buyers"?
	- How do we prevent bots?
- Do i know or have access to KPIs?
- What are the northstar metrics?
	- Where are we now
	- Where are we going
	- What's the metrics for profit
- What is the plan for growth?  What happens if trading activity plummets?  we're in a bear market.
- Anticipate longer work hours.  Startups are intense, things happen and break and require all hands on deck.  Startups are always shorthanded.
- Months of cushion?
