## Metro-E issues
- Everything looks like normal install, indoor ONT with a cat5 copper handoff
- 3 Key components to be passed along:
	- Type of handoff:
		- copper
		- fiber
			- SMF/MMF
	- Autonegotiate or hard-coded
	- Jumbo frames or not
- Tiffany's team should reject the order if the info is not in the oppty
	- How does Tiffany's team know?  Do we need to provide documentation?
		- Create a matrix/flowchart for NID vs ONT
		- Is tiffany's team aware that an SLA charge code requires a different order type and equipment?

### Temporary Connection from Larose Civic Center to LOOP OC
- SO#s 1029639 & 1029638

#### 1029638
This order is for the Larose side of the P2P. On 10/5/23 Sherry Deveer mentioned how this would be installed, but on 10/27/23 "M4Workforce" notes show that we need to install an ASR920 at Larose.  

Look at my emails, I said 1029638 would use the LOOP ASR920 at Cut Off.  I got the wrong SO#.  

#### 1029639
This order is for the LOOP OC side.  Needs to just be a port on the ASR920.
