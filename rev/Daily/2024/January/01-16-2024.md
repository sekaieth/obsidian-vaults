- Station alerting is moving to an automated alerting system
- private IP network can get them around the issues for station alerting
- station alerting systems require IP connectivity
They need a private wan for this.  This is high priority/critical, so we should set this up on traditional metro-e.  Need them to tell us about any potential SLA requirements.

They need to get documentation for the new system requirements

### Call Recording 
They like the system but they want search to be improved.
