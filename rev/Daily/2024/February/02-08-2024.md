- Satellite mesh WAN with an internet drain.  Internet drain is in California, so has extra latency and multiple ops.  WAN is preferable for performance.
- LOOP has a public facing IP from satellite for VSAT phones
- Microwave is layer two
- We have VLANS available between Galliano and LOCAP and Galliano and MT
- Satellite Layer two
- Main data hubs Galliano and Northpark
- Remote sites needing phone transport: Marine Terminal and LOCAPÂ 
- We may have to modify to add VLANs




Work with what LOOP networks are vailable at each location (HQ doesn't have microwave, so only need to do ASR920 and satellite)



Call recording - do they have a digital signature/certificate that shows they were not manipulated/changed

### Converting wave to switched circuit
We would need to install a new Cisco NCS540 Galapagos in TGMC and migrate services to it, and uplink it with 20Gb LAGs to HOMA and TBDO, which do have NCS540s Tortins.

In addition, we will need to install a NID inside of Venyu to hand this off, as it would also need an SLA.
