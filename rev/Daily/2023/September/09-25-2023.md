### [[Customers/LOOP|LOOP]]
Andre got with Eddie & LOOP about a 1Gb wave from Lumen.  It's been approved and should be getting ordered today (9/25) or tomorrow (9/26).

### [[Carriers/Granite|Granite]]
Granite wants to turn up an NNI so we can sell circuits to them.  They already signed an NDA.  Andre sent the KMZ to Romi to send to Granite.

### [[City of Thibodaux|City of Thibodaux]]
Eddie asked for some updates to the KMZ.  
>  Can we simply use 2 colors for routes (sites going to Houma and sites going to Thibodaux)?  I would like for the sites going to Houma to show it going all the way to the office.  On the Houma office, I want to remove the “AT&T” part.  We need to refer to this as our Houma office.  Last, I am pretty sure that isn’t the location for the North Sewer Plant.  It is further north on the road (you can see it on the map).  The current pin is in the middle of a subdivision.

Updated the North Sewer pin and asked Paul to update the KMZ
