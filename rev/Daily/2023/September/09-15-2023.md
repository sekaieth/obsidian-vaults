Call with OSP about how we can diversify the circuits

Fiber bottleneck is at Schreiver site, 144ct coming out of the site but it turns into a 288 at HWY 3185.  We can build a small route down candy lane & Parish Rd to ensure we can get to HOMA if need be.  OSP will do some homework on whether the build is necessary.
