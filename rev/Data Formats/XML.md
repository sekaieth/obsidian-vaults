## XML
XML is a language to store & describe data.  It does not actually perform any operations.  XML uses a tree structure, and the tagged items are called elements (similar to HTML)

- Any word can be used for element tags (except for XML)
- Element tags are case sensitive
- No spaces are allowed
	- Use underscores or hyphens to separate words
- Element tags must start with either underscore or a letter
- Can add comments to XML
